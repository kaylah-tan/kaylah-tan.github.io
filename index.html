                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello, and welcome to my website! My name is Kaylah Tan. I am currently a senior year student pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Whitman College. Originally from Tacoma, Washington, I hope to bridge my interests at the intersection of data science, software engineering, and human-computer interaction.</p>
                <p>I’m not one for labels, but if I had to describe myself, I’d say I’m a people person. Connecting with others is what brings me the most joy, and my favorite way to start a conversation is by asking, "What is the highlight of your day so far?" I believe that the key to solving real-world challenges often begins with a simple search and evolves into a scalable, adaptable solution.</p>
