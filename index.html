            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, and welcome to my website! I'm Kaylah Tan, a senior studying Computer Science at Whitman College. Originally from Tacoma, Washington, I’m passionate about exploring the intersections of data science, software engineering, and human-computer interaction to create meaningful, user-centered solutions.</p>
            <p>I love connecting with people, and my go-to conversation starter is, "What’s been the highlight of your day so far?" I believe the most impactful solutions often start with a simple question or search and evolve into something adaptable and scalable. My aim is to bridge technical skills with empathy to address real-world challenges in a way that’s both innovative and accessible.</p>
